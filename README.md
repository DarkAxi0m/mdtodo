# mdtodo
mdtodo is Another command-line interface (CLI) tool that manages your to-do list and saves it in a Markdown (.md) file. 
This approach combines the simplicity of plain text with the structured formatting of Markdown, making your tasks easy to read and manage.

_Note: This project is a learning exercise for me to explore Go. I'm using it on my machine for development and task tracking, but use it at your own risk._


[gocui](https://github.com/jesseduffield/gocui) is used for the Console User Interfaces. gocui is a minimalistic Go-based library that provides a terminal UI, allowing for an interactive and efficient user experience directly in the terminal.

## todo
- [ ] lots, see [todo.md](todo.md) ;)


## Wakatime
If the `wakatime-cli` is detected in your systemâ€™s PATH, the tool will automatically send [Wakatime HeartBeats](https://wakatime.com).  
Currently, it neither installs nor configures `wakatime-cli` if the executable is not found.
