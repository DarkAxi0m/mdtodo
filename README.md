# mdtodo
mdtodo is Another command-line interface (CLI) tool that manages your to-do list and saves it in a Markdown (.md) file. 
This approach combines the simplicity of plain text with the structured formatting of Markdown, making your tasks easy to read and manage.

Note: This project is a learning exercise for me to explore Go. I'm using it on my machine for development and task tracking, but use it at your own risk.

## todo
- [ ] lots, see [todo.md](todo.md) ;)
